# Mongoose OS documentation

Mongoose OS is a firmware development framework for microcontrollers.

Mongoose OS was created for developers who work on commercial connected
products, and care about things like manageability, security, and reliability.
80-90% of the commercial firmware is around infrastructure, which is the same
for many products regardless of what they do. Mongoose OS provides such a
reliable, field-tested infrastructure.
